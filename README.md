### Hi! I'm Soumya! :)

I work on Trustworthy Medical Image Analysis.

I primarily have 4 types of repos.

1. Papers (Filter keyword: Official) -- Code for my published papers and preprints.
2. Code Optimisations (Filter keyword: Optimisation) -- Trying to solve issues I and others face on a daily basis (or rarely!)
3. Tutorials (Filter keyword: Tutorials) -- These are helpful tutorials I have created to help myself and hopefully you :)
4. Hackathon Projects (Filter keyword: Hackathon) -- Code of my projects built during Hackathons.
